# The Facial Recognizerer

If working on this at HackDavis, we'd probably need to

- Set up the project/camera to work with OpenCV
- Use OpenCV to detect faces
- Figure out how to upload a collection of faces to your phone (probably just --> filesystem)
- Implement identification
- Figure out how to save attendance as CSV file / upload to computer
- Design (logo, mockups, artwork for mockups, overall layout and all stylistic choices)
- Nice interface for switching between activities / screens (alternatively, nice menu interface)
- Figure out a decent format for camera overlay text
- Optimize everything; this needs to be fast
